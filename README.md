# Customer-Service-Analysis

This is a personal project I worked on to understand a typical customer service dataset.
The challenge here was that there was no designated label in the set and so it was interesting to explore the data and decide on a business impacting problem to solve.

# Motivation

With competition increasing every day in the business world, it has become more and more imperative for businesses to focus on customer service.
The growing consumption of digital technology has made customers demand for a one-time immediate resolution for the issue. So, for this particular firm (that is ananoymized), I wanted to explore the reasons for repeat visits by customers and ways to reduce that.
Also, I have looked at proactive measures instead of reactive fixes to customer issues.

# Data

The data set has information of repair logs and service rendered by a firm and its' agents. The data is anonymized and so some feature imformation has been replaced.

# Approach

1. Data pre-processing and Data Exploration
2. Feature Engineering
3. Imputation, Sampling and Feature Selection
4. Model Building and performance
5. Recommendations

# Insights and Recommendations

1. Soft issues have no repeat. So, aim to help these customers self solve the issue using the support tool
2. Repeats are likely because fixing a motherboard is a more complex issue. Consider checking quality of the vendor, replacement if it justifies the cost
or equip service centers to handle these issues.
3. Consider checking clarity and length of the documentation
4. Training to agents on using diagnostic tool effectively (Focus on Email and Voice)
5. Communicate FAQ/ information on support tool to new customers during the time of warranty start.
